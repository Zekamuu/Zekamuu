Hey there! I'm **Rohan Nagashetti** (GitHub: [@zekamuu](https://github.com/zekamuu))

### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

💡 My core mission is to build **digital public goods**: open-access technology and data solutions that accelerate global collaboration and progress. This philosophy—that technology's greatest power lies in fostering global collaboration—was solidified during my environmental internship.

🌍 I apply this vision primarily to **environmental and geospatial challenges**, leveraging open-source remote sensing data and tools. For instance, I used Python and Copernicus Sentinel 5P data to pinpoint industrial and agricultural pollution sources in New Delhi for climate advocacy. I also co-developed a multilingual web tool to recommend natural soil additives based on NPK values, supporting sustainable agriculture.

🎓 I am driven to pursue **Electrical and Computer Engineering**, with the goal of designing the next generation of efficient sensors and ML algorithms necessary for developing scalable data collection and analysis platforms.

🤖 I served as the Captain of my FTC robotics team, leading us to receive the prestigious **Innovate Award two out of three years**. I specialize in developing robust software architectures for complex hardware, including implementing PID control loops and motion planning libraries like Road Runner. My work focused on integrating diverse sensors, including color, magnetic, camera, and odometry inputs.

✍️ In my free time, I explore financial data analysis and trading algorithms, viewing the stock market as an intricate system requiring skills, insight, and experience.
