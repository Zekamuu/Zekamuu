Hey there! I'm **Rohan Nagashetti** (GitHub: [@zekamuu](https://github.com/zekamuu))

### 👨🏻‍💻  About Me

💡 My mission is to build **digital public goods**: open-access technology and data solutions that drive global collaboration and progress [1, 4]. This philosophy—that technology's greatest power lies in fostering global collaboration—was crystallized during my environmental internship [4, 5].

🌍 I apply this vision primarily to **environmental and geospatial challenges**, using open-source remote sensing data and tools to create actionable solutions [6, 7].

🎓 I am focused on pursuing **Electrical and Computer Engineering**, driven by the goal of designing the next generation of efficient sensors and ML algorithms necessary for scalable data collection and analysis platforms [8-10].

🤖 I served as the Captain of my FTC robotics team [11, 12], leading us to receive the prestigious **Innovate Award two out of three years** [13-15]. I specialize in developing robust software architectures for complex hardware, including implementing PID control loops and motion planning libraries like Road Runner [16, 17].

✍️ In my free time, I explore financial data analysis and trading algorithms, viewing the stock market as an intricate system requiring skills, insight, and experience [18, 19].
